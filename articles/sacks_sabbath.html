<hr  />

<p>
My mother and her 17 brothers and sisters had an Orthodox upbringing &mdash;
all photographs of their father show him wearing a yarmulke, and I was
told that he woke up if it fell off during the night. My father, too,
came from an Orthodox background. Both my parents were very conscious
of the Fourth Commandment (“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it
holy”), and the Sabbath (Shabbos, as we called it in our Litvak way)
was entirely different from the rest of the week. No work was allowed,
no driving, no use of the telephone; it was forbidden to switch on a
light or a stove. Being physicians, my parents made exceptions. They
could not take the phone off the hook or completely avoid driving;
they had to be available, if necessary, to see patients, or operate,
or deliver babies.
</p>

<p>
We lived in a fairly Orthodox Jewish community in Cricklewood, in
Northwest London &mdash; the butcher, the baker, the grocer, the
greengrocer, the fishmonger, all closed their shops in good time for
the Shabbos, and did not open their shutters till Sunday morning. All
of them, and all our neighbors, we imagined, were celebrating Shabbos
in much the same fashion as we did.
</p>

<p>
Around midday on Friday, my mother doffed her surgical identity and
attire and devoted herself to making gefilte fish and other delicacies
for Shabbos. Just before evening fell, she would light the ritual
candles, cupping their flames with her hands, and murmuring a
prayer. We would all put on clean, fresh Shabbos clothes, and gather
for the first meal of the Sabbath, the evening meal. My father would
lift his silver wine cup and chant the blessings and the Kiddush, and
after the meal, he would lead us all in chanting the grace.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday mornings, my three brothers and I trailed our parents to
Cricklewood Synagogue on Walm Lane, a huge shul built in the 1930s to
accommodate part of the exodus of Jews from the East End to
Cricklewood at that time. The shul was always full during my boyhood,
and we all had our assigned seats, the men downstairs, the women &mdash; my
mother, various aunts and cousins &mdash; upstairs; as a little boy, I
sometimes waved to them during the service. Though I could not
understand the Hebrew in the prayer book, I loved its sound and
especially hearing the old medieval prayers sung, led by our
wonderfully musical hazan.
</p>

<p>
All of us met and mingled outside the synagogue after the service &mdash;
and we would usually walk to the house of my Auntie Florrie and her
three children to say a Kiddush, accompanied by sweet red wine and
honey cakes, just enough to stimulate our appetites for lunch. After a
cold lunch at home &mdash; gefilte fish, poached salmon, beetroot jelly &mdash;
Saturday afternoons, if not interrupted by emergency medical calls for
my parents, would be devoted to family visits. Uncles and aunts and
cousins would visit us for tea, or we them; we all lived within
walking distance of one another.
</p>

<p>
The Second World War decimated our Jewish community in Cricklewood,
and the Jewish community in England as a whole was to lose thousands
of people in the postwar years. Many Jews, including cousins of mine,
emigrated to Israel; others went to Australia, Canada or the States;
my eldest brother, Marcus, went to Australia in 1950. Many of those
who stayed assimilated and adopted diluted, attenuated forms of
Judaism. Our synagogue, which would be packed to capacity when I was a
child, grew emptier by the year.
</p>

<p>
I chanted my bar mitzvah portion in 1946 to a relatively full
synagogue, including several dozen of my relatives, but this, for me,
was the end of formal Jewish practice. I did not embrace the ritual
duties of a Jewish adult &mdash; praying every day, putting on tefillin
before prayer each weekday morning &mdash; and I gradually became more
indifferent to the beliefs and habits of my parents, though there was
no particular point of rupture until I was 18. It was then that my
father, inquiring into my sexual feelings, compelled me to admit that
I liked boys.
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t <i>done</i> anything,” I said, “it’s just a feeling &mdash; but don’t
tell Ma, she won’t be able to take it.”
</p>

<p>
He <i>did</i> tell her, and the next morning she came down with a look of
horror on her face, and shrieked at me: “You are an abomination. I
wish you had never been born.” (She was no doubt thinking of the verse
in Leviticus that read, “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth
with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: They shall
surely be put to death; their blood <i>shall</i> be upon them.”)
</p>

<p>
The matter was never mentioned again, but her harsh words made me hate
religion’s capacity for bigotry and cruelty.
</p>

<p>
After I qualified as a doctor in 1960, I removed myself abruptly from
England and what family and community I had there, and went to the New
World, where I knew nobody. When I moved to Los Angeles, I found a
sort of community among the weight lifters on Muscle Beach, and with
my fellow neurology residents at U.C.L.A., but I craved some deeper
connection &mdash; “meaning” &mdash; in my life, and it was the absence of this, I
think, that drew me into near-suicidal addiction to amphetamines in
the 1960s.
</p>

<p>
Recovery started, slowly, as I found meaningful work in New York, in a
chronic care hospital in the Bronx (the “Mount Carmel” I wrote about
in “Awakenings”). I was fascinated by my patients there, cared for
them deeply, and felt something of a mission to tell their stories &mdash;
stories of situations virtually unknown, almost unimaginable, to the
general public and, indeed, to many of my colleagues. I had discovered
my vocation, and this I pursued doggedly, single-mindedly, with little
encouragement from my colleagues. Almost unconsciously, I became a
storyteller at a time when medical narrative was almost extinct. This
did not dissuade me, for I felt my roots lay in the great neurological
case histories of the 19th century (and I was encouraged here by the
great Russian neuropsychologist A. R. Luria). It was a lonely but
deeply satisfying, almost monkish existence that I was to lead for
many years.
</p>

<p>
During the 1990s, I came to know a cousin and contemporary of mine,
Robert John Aumann, a man of remarkable appearance with his robust,
athletic build and long white beard that made him, even at 60, look
like an ancient sage. He is a man of great intellectual power but also
of great human warmth and tenderness, and deep religious commitment &mdash;
“commitment,” indeed, is one of his favorite words. Although, in his
work, he stands for rationality in economics and human affairs, there
is no conflict for him between reason and faith.
</p>

<p>
He insisted I have a mezuza on my door, and brought me one from
Israel. “I know you don’t believe,” he said, “but you should have one
anyhow.” I didn’t argue.
</p>

<p>
In a remarkable 2004 interview, Robert John spoke of his lifelong work
in mathematics and game theory, but also of his family &mdash; how he would
go skiing and mountaineering with some of his nearly 30 children and
grandchildren (a kosher cook, carrying saucepans, would accompany
them), and the importance of the Sabbath to him.
</p>

<p>
“The observance of the Sabbath is extremely beautiful,” he said, “and
is impossible without being religious. It is not even a question of
improving society &mdash; it is about improving one’s own quality of life.”
</p>

<p>
In December of 2005, Robert John received a Nobel Prize for his 50
years of fundamental work in economics. He was not entirely an easy
guest for the Nobel Committee, for he went to Stockholm with his
family, including many of those children and grandchildren, and all
had to have special kosher plates, utensils and food, and special
formal clothes, with no biblically forbidden admixture of wool and
linen.
</p>

<p>
That same month, I was found to have cancer in one eye, and while I
was in the hospital for treatment the following month, Robert John
visited. He was full of entertaining stories about the Nobel Prize and
the ceremony in Stockholm, but made a point of saying that, had he
been compelled to travel to Stockholm on a Saturday, he would have
refused the prize. His commitment to the Sabbath, its utter
peacefulness and remoteness from worldly concerns, would have trumped
even a Nobel.
</p>

<p>
In 1955, as a 22-year-old, I went to Israel for several months to work
on a kibbutz, and though I enjoyed it, I decided not to go again. Even
though so many of my cousins had moved there, the politics of the
Middle East disturbed me, and I suspected I would be out of place in a
deeply religious society. But in the spring of 2014, hearing that my
cousin Marjorie &mdash; a physician who had been a protégée of my mother’s
and had worked in the field of medicine till the age of 98 &mdash; was
nearing death, I phoned her in Jerusalem to say farewell. Her voice
was unexpectedly strong and resonant, with an accent very much like my
mother’s. “I don’t intend to die now,” she said, “I will be having my
100th birthday on June 18th. Will you come?”
</p>

<p>
I said, “Yes, of course!” When I hung up, I realized that in a few
seconds I had reversed a decision of almost 60 years. It was purely a
family visit. I celebrated Marjorie’s 100th with her and extended
family. I saw two other cousins dear to me in my London days,
innumerable second and removed cousins, and, of course, Robert John. I
felt embraced by my family in a way I had not known since childhood.
</p>

<p>
I had felt a little fearful visiting my Orthodox family with my lover,
Billy &mdash; my mother’s words still echoed in my mind &mdash; but Billy, too,
was warmly received. How profoundly attitudes had changed, even among
the Orthodox, was made clear by Robert John when he invited Billy and
me to join him and his family at their opening Sabbath meal.
</p>

<p>
The peace of the Sabbath, of a stopped world, a time outside time, was
palpable, infused everything, and I found myself drenched with a
wistfulness, something akin to nostalgia, wondering <i>what if</i>: What if
A and B and C had been different? What sort of person might I have
been?  What sort of a life might I have lived?
</p>

<p>
In December 2014, I completed my memoir, “On the Move,” and gave the
manuscript to my publisher, not dreaming that days later I would learn
I had metastatic cancer, coming from the melanoma I had in my eye nine
years earlier. I am glad I was able to complete my memoir without
knowing this, and that I had been able, for the first time in my life,
to make a full and frank declaration of my sexuality, facing the world
openly, with no more guilty secrets locked up inside me.
</p>

<p>
In February, I felt I had to be equally open about my cancer &mdash; and
facing death. I was, in fact, in the hospital when my essay on this,
“My Own Life,” was published in this newspaper. In July I wrote
another piece for the paper, “My Periodic Table,” in which the
physical cosmos, and the elements I loved, took on lives of their own.
</p>

<p>
And now, weak, short of breath, my once-firm muscles melted away by
cancer, I find my thoughts, increasingly, not on the supernatural or
spiritual, but on what is meant by living a good and worthwhile life &mdash;
achieving a sense of peace within oneself. I find my thoughts drifting
to the Sabbath, the day of rest, the seventh day of the week, and
perhaps the seventh day of one’s life as well, when one can feel that
one’s work is done, and one may, in good conscience, rest.
