<h1 class="title">Antonin Scalia, God's Justice and Ours</h1>
<p>
<i>“First Things”, May 2002</i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://firstthings.com/article/2007/01/gods-justice-and-ours-32">http://firstthings.com/article/2007/01/gods-justice-and-ours-32</a>

<p>
<i>Antonin Scalia is a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</i>
</p>

<hr  />

<p>
Before proceeding to discuss the morality of capital punishment, I
want to make clear that my views on the subject have nothing to do
with how I vote in capital cases that come before the Supreme
Court. That statement would not be true if I subscribed to the
conventional fallacy that the Constitution is a “living document”—that
is, a text that means from age to age whatever the society (or perhaps
the Court) thinks it ought to mean.
</p>

<p>
In recent years, that philosophy has been particularly well enshrined
in our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, our case law dealing with the
prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.” Several of our
opinions have said that what falls within this prohibition is not
static, but changes from generation to generation, to comport with
“the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a
maturing society.” Applying that principle, the Court came close, in
1972, to abolishing the death penalty entirely. It ultimately did not
do so, but it has imposed, under color of the Constitution, procedural
and substantive limitations that did not exist when the Eighth
Amendment was adopted—and some of which had not even been adopted by a
majority of the states at the time they were judicially decreed. For
example, the Court has prohibited the death penalty for all crimes
except murder, and indeed even for what might be called
run–of–the–mill murders, as opposed to those that are somehow
characterized by a high degree of brutality or depravity. It has
prohibited the mandatory imposition of the death penalty for any
crime, insisting that in all cases the jury be permitted to consider
all mitigating factors and to impose, if it wishes, a lesser
sentence. And it has imposed an age limit at the time of the offense
(it is currently seventeen) that is well above what existed at common
law.
</p>

<p>
If I subscribed to the proposition that I am authorized (indeed, I
suppose compelled) to intuit and impose our “maturing” society’s
“evolving standards of decency,” this essay would be a preview of my
next vote in a death penalty case. As it is, however, the Constitution
that I interpret and apply is not living but dead—or, as I prefer to
put it, enduring. It means today not what current society (much less
the Court) thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was
adopted. For me, therefore, the constitutionality of the death penalty
is not a difficult, soul–wrenching question. It was clearly permitted
when the Eighth Amendment was adopted (not merely for murder, by the
way, but for all felonies—including, for example, horse–thieving, as
anyone can verify by watching a western movie). And so it is clearly
permitted today. There is plenty of room within this system for
“evolving standards of decency,” but the instrument of evolution (or,
if you are more tolerant of the Court’s approach, the herald that
evolution has occurred) is not the nine lawyers who sit on the Supreme
Court of the United States, but the Congress of the United States and
the legislatures of the fifty states, who may, within their own
jurisdictions, restrict or abolish the death penalty as they wish.
</p>

<p>
But while my views on the morality of the death penalty have nothing
to do with how I vote as a judge, they have a lot to do with whether I
can or should be a judge at all. To put the point in the blunt terms
employed by Justice Harold Blackmun towards the end of his career on
the bench, when he announced that he would henceforth vote (as
Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall had previously done) to
overturn all death sentences, when I sit on a Court that reviews and
affirms capital convictions, I am part of “the machinery of death.” My
vote, when joined with at least four others, is, in most cases, the
last step that permits an execution to proceed. I could not take part
in that process if I believed what was being done to be immoral.
</p>

<p>
Capital cases are much different from the other life–and–death issues
that my Court sometimes faces: abortion, for example, or legalized
suicide. There it is not the state (of which I am in a sense the last
instrument) that is decreeing death, but rather private individuals
whom the state has decided not to restrain. One may argue (as many do)
that the society has a moral obligation to restrain. That moral
obligation may weigh heavily upon the voter, and upon the legislator
who enacts the laws; but a judge, I think, bears no moral guilt for
the laws society has failed to enact. Thus, my difficulty with Roe
v. Wade is a legal rather than a moral one: I do not believe (and, for
two hundred years, no one believed) that the Constitution contains a
right to abortion. And if a state were to permit abortion on demand, I
would—and could in good conscience—vote against an attempt to
invalidate that law for the same reason that I vote against the
invalidation of laws that forbid abortion on demand: because the
Constitution gives the federal government (and hence me) no power over
the matter.
</p>

<p>
With the death penalty, on the other hand, I am part of the
criminal–law machinery that imposes death—which extends from the
indictment, to the jury conviction, to rejection of the last appeal. I
am aware of the ethical principle that one can give “material
cooperation” to the immoral act of another when the evil that would
attend failure to cooperate is even greater (for example, helping a
burglar tie up a householder where the alternative is that the burglar
would kill the householder). I doubt whether that doctrine is even
applicable to the trial judges and jurors who must themselves
determine that the death sentence will be imposed. It seems to me
these individuals are not merely engaged in “material cooperation”
with someone else’s action, but are themselves decreeing death on
behalf of the state.
</p>

<p>
The same is true of appellate judges in those states where they are
charged with “reweighing” the mitigating and aggravating factors and
determining de novo whether the death penalty should be imposed: they
are themselves decreeing death. Where (as is the case in the federal
system) the appellate judge merely determines that the sentence
pronounced by the trial court is in accordance with law, perhaps the
principle of material cooperation could be applied. But as I have
said, that principle demands that the good deriving from the
cooperation exceed the evil which is assisted. I find it hard to see
how any appellate judge could find this condition to be met, unless he
believes retaining his seat on the bench (rather than resigning) is
somehow essential to preservation of the society—which is of course
absurd. (As Charles de Gaulle is reputed to have remarked when his
aides told him he could not resign as President of France because he
was the indispensable man: “Mon ami, the cemeteries are full of
indispensable men.”)
</p>

<p>
I pause here to emphasize the point that in my view the choice for the
judge who believes the death penalty to be immoral is resignation,
rather than simply ignoring duly enacted, constitutional laws and
sabotaging death penalty cases. He has, after all, taken an oath to
apply the laws and has been given no power to supplant them with rules
of his own. Of course if he feels strongly enough he can go beyond
mere resignation and lead a political campaign to abolish the death
penalty—and if that fails, lead a revolution. But rewrite the laws he
cannot do. This dilemma, of course, need not be confronted by a
proponent of the “living Constitution,” who believes that it means
what it ought to mean. If the death penalty is (in his view) immoral,
then it is (hey, presto!) automatically unconstitutional, and he can
continue to sit while nullifying a sanction that has been imposed,
with no suggestion of its unconstitutionality, since the beginning of
the Republic. (You can see why the “living Constitution” has such
attraction for us judges.)
</p>

<p>
It is a matter of great consequence to me, therefore, whether the
death penalty is morally acceptable. As a Roman Catholic—and being
unable to jump out of my skin—I cannot discuss that issue without
reference to Christian tradition and the Church’s Magisterium.
</p>

<p>
The death penalty is undoubtedly wrong unless one accords to the state
a scope of moral action that goes beyond what is permitted to the
individual. In my view, the major impetus behind modern aversion to
the death penalty is the equation of private morality with
governmental morality. This is a predictable (though I believe
erroneous and regrettable) reaction to modern, democratic
self–government.
</p>

<p>
Few doubted the morality of the death penalty in the age that believed
in the divine right of kings. Or even in earlier times. St. Paul had
this to say (I am quoting, as you might expect, the King James
version):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and
they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are
not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be
afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise
of the same: for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if
thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for
wrath, but also for conscience sake. (Romans 13:1–5)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is not the Old Testament, I emphasize, but St. Paul. One can
understand his words as referring only to lawfully constituted
authority, or even only to lawfully constituted authority that rules
justly. But the core of his message is that government—however you
want to limit that concept—derives its moral authority from God. It is
the “minister of God” with powers to “revenge,” to “execute wrath,”
including even wrath by the sword (which is unmistakably a reference
to the death penalty). Paul of course did not believe that the
individual possessed any such powers. Only a few lines before this
passage, he wrote, “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather
give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will
repay, saith the Lord.” And in this world the Lord repaid—did
justice—through His minister, the state.
</p>

<p>
These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought
until very recent times. Not just of Christian or religious thought,
but of secular thought regarding the powers of the state. That
consensus has been upset, I think, by the emergence of democracy. It
is easy to see the hand of the Almighty behind rulers whose forebears,
in the dim mists of history, were supposedly anointed by God, or who
at least obtained their thrones in awful and unpredictable battles
whose outcome was determined by the Lord of Hosts, that is, the Lord
of Armies. It is much more difficult to see the hand of God—or any
higher moral authority—behind the fools and rogues (as the losers
would have it) whom we ourselves elect to do our own will. How can
their power to avenge—to vindicate the “public order”—be any greater
than our own?
</p>

<p>
So it is no accident, I think, that the modern view that the death
penalty is immoral is centered in the West. That has little to do with
the fact that the West has a Christian tradition, and everything to do
with the fact that the West is the home of democracy. Indeed, it seems
to me that the more Christian a country is the <i>less</i> likely it is to
regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest
hold in post–Christian Europe, and has least support in the
church–going United States. I attribute that to the fact that, for the
believing Christian, death is no big deal. Intentionally killing an
innocent person is a big deal: it is a grave sin, which causes one to
lose his soul. But losing this life, in exchange for the next? The
Christian attitude is reflected in the words Robert Bolt’s play has
Thomas More saying to the headsman: “Friend, be not afraid of your
office. You send me to God.” And when Cranmer asks whether he is sure
of that, More replies, “He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go
to Him.” For the nonbeliever, on the other hand, to deprive a man of
his life is to end his existence. What a horrible act!
</p>

<p>
Besides being <i>less</i> likely to regard death as an utterly cataclysmic
punishment, the Christian is also <i>more</i> likely to regard punishment in
general as deserved. The doctrine of free will—the ability of man to
resist temptations to evil, which God will not permit beyond man’s
capacity to resist—is central to the Christian doctrine of salvation
and damnation, heaven and hell. The post–Freudian secularist, on the
other hand, is more inclined to think that people are what their
history and circumstances have made them, and there is little sense in
assigning blame.
</p>

<p>
Of course those who deny the authority of a government to exact
vengeance are not entirely logical. Many crimes—for example, domestic
murder in the heat of passion—are neither deterred by punishment meted
out to others nor likely to be committed a second time by the same
offender. Yet opponents of capital punishment do not object to sending
such an offender to prison, perhaps for life. Because he <i>deserves</i>
punishment. Because it is <i>just</i>.
</p>

<p>
The mistaken tendency to believe that a democratic government, being
nothing more than the composite will of its individual citizens, has
no more moral power or authority than they do as individuals has
adverse effects in other areas as well. It fosters civil disobedience,
for example, which proceeds on the assumption that what the individual
citizen considers an unjust law—even if it does not compel <i>him</i> to act
unjustly—need not be obeyed. St. Paul would not agree. “Ye must needs
be subject,” he said, “not only for wrath, but also for conscience
sake.” For conscience sake. The reaction of people of faith to this
tendency of democracy to obscure the divine authority behind
government should not be resignation to it, but the resolution to
combat it as effectively as possible. We have done that in this
country (and continental Europe has not) by preserving in our public
life many visible reminders that—in the words of a Supreme Court
opinion from the 1940s—“we are a religious people, whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.” These reminders include: “In God we
trust” on our coins, “one nation, under God” in our Pledge of
Allegiance, the opening of sessions of our legislatures with a prayer,
the opening of sessions of my Court with “God save the United States
and this Honorable Court,” annual Thanksgiving proclamations issued by
our President at the direction of Congress, and constant invocations
of divine support in the speeches of our political leaders, which
often conclude, “God bless America.” All this, as I say, is most
un–European, and helps explain why our people are more inclined to
understand, as St. Paul did, that government carries the sword as “the
minister of God,” to “execute wrath” upon the evildoer.
</p>

<p>
A brief story about the aftermath of September 11 nicely illustrates
how different things are in secularized Europe. I was at a conference
of European and American lawyers and jurists in Rome when the planes
struck the twin towers. All in attendance were transfixed by the
horror of the event, and listened with rapt attention to the
President’s ensuing address to the nation. When the speech had
concluded, one of the European conferees—a religious man—confided in
me how jealous he was that the leader of my nation could conclude his
address with the words “God bless the United States.” Such invocation
of the deity, he assured me, was absolutely unthinkable in his
country, with its Napoleonic tradition of extirpating religion from
public life.
</p>

<p>
It will come as no surprise from what I have said that I do not agree
with the encyclical <i>Evangelium Vitae</i> and the new Catholic catechism
(or the very latest version of the new Catholic catechism), according
to which the death penalty can only be imposed to protect rather than
avenge, and that since it is (in most modern societies) not necessary
for the former purpose, it is wrong. That, by the way, is how I read
those documents—and not, as Avery Cardinal Dulles would read them,
simply as an affirmation of two millennia of Christian teaching that
retribution is a proper purpose (indeed, the principal purpose) of
criminal punishment, but merely adding the “prudential judgment” that
in modern circumstances condign retribution “rarely if ever” justifies
death. (See “Catholicism &amp; Capital Punishment,” FT, April 2001.) I
cannot square that interpretation with the following passage from the
encyclical:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is clear that, for these [permissible purposes of penal justice] to
be achieved, the nature and extent of the punishment must be carefully
evaluated and decided upon, and ought not go to the extreme of
executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other
words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend
society. Today, however, as a result of steady improvements in the
organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not
practically nonexistent.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is true enough that the paragraph of the encyclical that precedes
this passage acknowledges (in accord with traditional Catholic
teaching) that “the primary purpose of the punishment which society
inflicts is ‘to redress the disorder caused by the offense’” by
“imposing on the offender an adequate punishment for the crime.” But
it seems to me quite impossible to interpret the later passage’s
phrase “when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society” as
including “defense” through the redress of disorder achieved by
adequate punishment. Not only does the word “defense” not readily lend
itself to that strange interpretation, but the immediately following
explanation of why, in modern times, “defense” rarely if ever requires
capital punishment <i>has no bearing whatever upon the adequacy of retribution</i>. In fact, one might say that it has an <i>inverse</i> bearing.
</p>

<p>
How in the world can modernity’s “steady improvements in the
organization of the penal system” render the death penalty less
condign for a particularly heinous crime? One might think that
commitment to a really horrible penal system (Devil’s Island, for
example) might be almost as bad as death. But nice clean cells with
television sets, exercise rooms, meals designed by nutritionists, and
conjugal visits? That would seem to render the death penalty more,
rather than less, necessary. So also would the greatly increased
capacity for evil—the greatly increased power to produce moral
“disorder”—placed in individual hands by modern technology. Could
St. Paul or St. Thomas even have envisioned a crime by an individual
(as opposed to one by a ruler, such as Herod’s slaughter of the
innocents) as enormous as that of Timothy McVeigh or of the men who
destroyed three thousand innocents in the World Trade Center? If just
retribution is a legitimate purpose (indeed, the principal legitimate
purpose) of capital punishment, can one possibly say with a straight
face that nowadays death would “rarely if ever” be appropriate?
</p>

<p>
So I take the encyclical and the latest, hot–off–the–presses version
of the catechism (a supposed encapsulation of the “deposit” of faith
and the Church’s teaching regarding a moral order that does not
change) to mean that retribution is not a valid purpose of capital
punishment. Unlike such other hard Catholic doctrines as the
prohibition of birth control and of abortion, this is not a moral
position that the Church has always — or indeed <i>ever before</i> —maintained. There have been Christian opponents of the death
penalty, just as there have been Christian pacifists, but neither of
those positions has ever been that of the Church. The current
predominance of opposition to the death penalty is the legacy of
Napoleon, Hegel, and Freud rather than St. Paul and St. Augustine. I
mentioned earlier Thomas More, who has long been regarded in this
country as the patron saint of lawyers, and who has recently been
declared by the Vatican the patron saint of politicians (I am not sure
that is a promotion). One of the charges leveled by that canonized
saint’s detractors was that, as Lord Chancellor, he was too quick to
impose the death penalty.
</p>

<p>
I am therefore happy to learn from the canonical experts I have
consulted that the position set forth in <i>Evangelium Vitae</i> and in the
latest version of the Catholic catechism does not purport to be
binding teaching—that is, it need not be accepted by practicing
Catholics, though they must give it thoughtful and respectful
consideration. It would be remarkable to think otherwise—that a couple
of paragraphs in an encyclical almost entirely devoted not to crime
and punishment but to abortion and euthanasia was intended
authoritatively to sweep aside (if one could) two thousand years of
Christian teaching.
</p>

<p>
So I have given this new position thoughtful and careful
consideration—and I disagree. That is not to say I favor the death
penalty (I am judicially and judiciously neutral on that point); it is
only to say that I do not find the death penalty immoral. I am happy
to have reached that conclusion, because I like my job, and would
rather not resign. And I am happy because I do not think it would be a
good thing if American Catholics running for legislative office had to
oppose the death penalty (most of them would not be elected); if
American Catholics running for Governor had to promise commutation of
all death sentences (most of them would never reach the Governor’s
mansion); if American Catholics were ineligible to go on the bench in
all jurisdictions imposing the death penalty; or if American Catholics
were subject to recusal when called for jury duty in capital cases.
</p>

<p>
I find it ironic that the Church’s new (albeit nonbinding) position on
the death penalty—which, if accepted, would have these <i>disastrous</i>
consequences—is said to rest upon “prudential considerations.” Is it
prudent, when one is not certain enough about the point to proclaim it
in a binding manner (and with good reason, given the long and
consistent Christian tradition to the contrary), to effectively urge
the retirement of Catholics from public life in a country where the
federal government and thirty–eight of the states (comprising about 85
percent of the population) believe the death penalty is sometimes just
and appropriate? Is it prudent to imperil acceptance of the Church’s
hard but traditional teachings on birth control and abortion and
euthanasia (teachings that <i>have been</i> proclaimed in a binding manner, a
distinction that the average Catholic layman is unlikely to grasp) by
packaging them—under the wrapper “respect for life”—with another
uncongenial doctrine <i>that everyone knows does not represent the traditional Christian view?</i> Perhaps, one is invited to conclude, all
four of them are recently made–up. We need some new staffers at the
Congregation of Prudence in the Vatican. At least the new doctrine
should have been urged only upon secular Europe, where it is at home.
