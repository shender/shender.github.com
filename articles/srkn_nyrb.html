<hr  />

<p>
<i>(Translated from the Russian by Jamey Gambrell)</i>
</p>

<p>
In the course of three days in August 1991, during the failed putsch
against Gorbachev, the decaying Soviet empire tottered and began to
collapse. Some friends and I found ourselves on Lubianskaya Square,
across from the headquarters of the fearsome, mighty KGB. A huge crowd
was preparing to topple the symbol of that sinister institution—the
statue of its founder, Dzerzhinsky, “Iron Felix” as his Bolshevik
comrades-in-arms called him. A few daredevils had scaled the monument
and wrapped cables around its neck, and a group was pulling on them to
ever louder shouts and cries from the assembled throng.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a Yeltsin associate with a megaphone appeared out of the
blue and directed everyone to hold off, because, he said, when the
bronze statue fell, “its head might crash through the pavement and
damage important underground communications.” The man said that a
crane was already on its way to remove Dzerzhinsky from the pedestal
without any damaging side effects. The revolutionary crowd waited for
this crane a good two hours, keeping its spirits up with shouts of
“Down with the KGB!”
</p>

<p>
Doubts about the success of the coming anti-Soviet revolution first
stirred in me during those two hours. I tried to imagine the Parisian
crowd, on May 16, 1871, waiting politely for an architect and workers
to remove the Vendôme Column. And I laughed. The crane finally
arrived; Dzerzhinsky was taken down, placed on a truck, and driven
away. People ran alongside and spat on him. Since then he has been on
view in the park of dismantled Soviet monuments next to the New
Tretiakov Gallery. Not long ago, a member of the Duma presented a
resolution to return the monument to its former location. Given events
currently taking place in our country, it’s quite likely that this
symbol of Bolshevik terror will return to Lubianskaya Square.
</p>

<p>
The swift dismantling of remaining Soviet monuments recently in
Ukraine caused me to remember the Dzerzhinsky episode. Dozens of
statues of Lenin fell in Ukrainian cities; no one in the opposition
asked people to treat them “in a civilized manner,” because in this
case a “polite” dismantling could mean only one thing—conserving a
potent symbol of Soviet power. “Dzhugashvili [Stalin] is there,
preserved in a jar,” as the poet Joseph Brodsky wrote in 1968. This
jar is the people’s memory, its collective unconscious.
</p>

<p>
In 2014, Lenins were felled in Ukraine and were allowed to
collapse. No one tried to preserve them. This “Leninfall” took place
during the brutal confrontation on Kiev’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti
(Independence Square), when Viktor Yanukovych’s power also collapsed,
demonstrating that a genuine anti-Soviet revolution had finally
occurred in Ukraine. No real revolution has happened in Russia. Lenin,
Stalin, and their bloody associates still repose on Red Square, and
hundreds of statues still stand, not only on Russia’s squares and
plazas, but in the minds of its citizens.
</p>

<p>
The fury of our politicians’ and bureaucrats’ response to the mass
destruction of Soviet idols in Ukraine is revealing. You might think,
why pity symbols of the past? But Russian bureaucrats understand that
their beloved <i>Homo sovieticus</i> crumbled along with Lenin. “They are
destroying monuments to Lenin because he personifies Russia!” one
politician exclaimed. Yes: Soviet Russia and the USSR, the ruthless
empire, built by Stalin, that enslaved whole peoples, created a
devastating famine in Ukraine, and carried out purges and mass
repressions. The recent Ukrainian revolution was indeed directed
against the heirs of that empire—Putin and Yanukovych. It is telling
that pro-Russian demonstrations in Crimea and eastern parts of Ukraine
invariably took place next to statues of Lenin.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, what happened in recent weeks in Ukraine did not happen
in Russia in 1991. Yeltsin’s revolution ended up being “velvet”: it
did not bury the Soviet past and did not pass judgment on its crimes,
as was the case in Germany after World War II. All those Party
functionaries who became instant “democrats” simply shoved the Soviet
corpse into a corner and covered it with sawdust. “It will rot on its
own!” they said.
</p>

<p>
Alas, it didn’t. In recent opinion polls, almost half of those
surveyed consider Stalin to have been a “good leader.” In the new
interpretation of history, Stalin is seen as an “effective manager,”
and the purges are characterized as a rotation of cadres necessary for
the modernization of the USSR. The Soviet Union may have collapsed
geographically and economically, but ideologically it survives in the
hearts of millions of <i>Homo sovieticus</i>. The Soviet mentality turned out
to be tenacious; it adapted to the wild capitalism of the 1990s and
began to mutate in the post-Soviet state. That tenacity is what
preserved a pyramidal system of power that goes back as far as Ivan
the Terrible and was strengthened by Stalin.

</p>

<p>
In my view, this fifteen-year journey back to the USSR under the
leadership of a former KGB lieutenant colonel has shown the world the
vicious nature and archaic underpinnings of the Russian state’s
“vertical power” structure, more than any “great and terrible”
Putin. With a monarchical structure such as this, the country
automatically becomes hostage to the psychosomatic quirks of its
leader. All of his fears, passions, weaknesses, and complexes become
state policy. If he is paranoid, the whole country must fear enemies
and spies; if he has insomnia, all the ministries must work at night;
if he’s a teetotaler, everyone must stop drinking; if he’s a
drunk—everyone should booze it up; if he doesn’t like America, which
his beloved KGB fought against, the whole population must dislike the
United States. A country such as this cannot have a predictable,
stable future; gradual development is extraordinarily difficult.
</p>

<p>
Unpredictability has always been Russia’s calling card, but since the
Ukrainian events, it has grown to unprecedented levels: no one knows
what will happen to our country in a month, in a week, or the day
after tomorrow. I think that even Putin doesn’t know; he is now
hostage to his own strategy of playing “bad guy” to the West. The
wheel of unpredictability has been spun; the rules of the game have
been set. The trump card of Putin’s first decade was stability, which
he used to destroy opposition and drive it underground. Now he’s
playing the capricious, unpredictable Queen of Spades. This card will
beat any ace.
</p>

<p>
The phrase “Russia in the Shadows,” as H.G. Wells titled his book on
Bolshevik Russia, has been on the minds of many Russian citizens
lately. One hears things like “The ground trembled beneath us!” all
the time now. The huge iceberg Russia, frozen by the Putin regime,
cracked after the events in Crimea; it has split from the European
world, and sailed off into the unknown. No one knows what will happen
to the country now, into which seas or swamps it will drift. At such
times, it’s better to rely on intuition than common sense. My most
perceptive compatriots feel that when Russia seized Crimea from
Ukraine, it bit off more than it will be able to chew or digest. The
state’s teeth are not what they were, and for that matter, its stomach
doesn’t work as it once did.
</p>

<p>
If you compare the post-Soviet bear to the Soviet one, the only thing
they have in common is the imperial roar. However, the post-Soviet
bear is teeming with corrupt parasites that infected it during the
1990s, and have multiplied exponentially in the last decade. They are
consuming the bear from within. Some might mistake their fevered
movement under the bear’s hide for the working of powerful
muscles. But in truth, it’s an illusion. There are no muscles, the
bear’s teeth have worn down, and its brain is buffeted by the random
firing of contradictory neurological impulses: “Get rich!”
“Modernize!” “Steal!” “Pray!” “Build Great Mother Russia!” “Resurrect
the USSR!” “Beware of the West!” “Invest in Western real estate!”
“Keep your savings in dollars and euros!” “Vacation in Courchevel!”
“Be patriotic!” “Search and destroy the enemies within!”
</p>

<p>
On the subject of enemies within… In his speech about the accession of
Crimea to Russia, President Putin mentioned a “fifth column” and
“national traitors” who are supposedly preventing Russia from moving
victoriously forward. As many have already remarked, the expression
“national traitor” comes from Mein Kampf. These words, spoken by the
head of state, caused a great deal of alarm in many Russian
citizens. The intelligentsia went into shock. The Russian
intelligentsia, it should be said, is now especially alarmed. While
the people shout “Crimea is ours!” at government demonstrations, our
intelligentsia carries on its usual defeatist conversations:
</p>

<p>
“There will be purges, like in ’37…”
</p>

<p>
“He won’t stop at Ukraine…”
</p>

<p>
“Looks like it’s time to leave the country…”
</p>

<p>
“You just can’t watch TV anymore—all they show is propaganda…”
</p>

<p>
“The West will turn its back on us…”
</p>

<p>
“Russia will be a pariah…”
</p>

<p>
“It’s all making me really depressed…”
</p>

<p>
“Samizdat and the underground will be back again…”
</p>

<p>
I confess that conversations like these make me sicker than the
annexation of Crimea. I want to say to my fellow <i>intelligenty</i>:
“Friends, over the last fifteen years comrade Putin has become what he
is now only because of our own weakness.”
</p>

<p>
Ukraine has taught Russia a lesson in loving freedom and refusing to
tolerate a base, thieving regime. Ukraine found the strength to break
away from the post-Soviet iceberg and sail toward
Europe. Maidan—Independence Square—showed the world what a people can
accomplish when it so desires. But when I watched the reports from
Kiev, I could not imagine anything similar in today’s Moscow. It is
difficult to imagine Muscovites fighting the OMON special forces day
and night on Red Square and facing snipers’ bullets with wooden
shields. For that to happen, something must change not only in the
surrounding environment, but in people’s heads. Will it?
</p>

<p>
We shouldn’t have waited for the crane to arrive at Lubianskaya Square
in August 1991. We should have toppled the iron idol even if its head
did crash through the pavement and damage “important underground
communications.”
</p>

<p>
We would live in a different country now.
</p>

<p>
How important it is, as it turns out, to let the past collapse at the
right time…
