<p>
<i>The following article will appear in The New York Review’s November 20 issue.</i>
</p>

<hr  />

<p>
Europe is facing a challenge from Russia to its very
existence. Neither the European leaders nor their citizens are fully
aware of this challenge or know how best to deal with it. I attribute
this mainly to the fact that the European Union in general and the
eurozone in particular lost their way after the financial crisis
of 2008.
</p>

<p>
The fiscal rules that currently prevail in Europe have aroused a lot
of popular resentment. Anti-Europe parties captured nearly 30 percent
of the seats in the latest elections for the European Parliament but
they had no realistic alternative to the EU to point to until
recently. Now Russia is presenting an alternative that poses a
fundamental challenge to the values and principles on which the
European Union was originally founded. It is based on the use of force
that manifests itself in repression at home and aggression abroad, as
opposed to the rule of law. What is shocking is that Vladimir Putin’s
Russia has proved to be in some ways superior to the European
Union—more flexible and constantly springing surprises. That has given
it a tactical advantage, at least in the near term.
</p>

<p>
Europe and the United States—each for its own reasons—are determined
to avoid any direct military confrontation with Russia. Russia is
taking advantage of their reluctance. Violating its treaty
obligations, Russia has annexed Crimea and established separatist
enclaves in eastern Ukraine. In August, when the recently installed
government in Kiev threatened to win the low-level war in eastern
Ukraine against separatist forces backed by Russia, President Putin
invaded Ukraine with regular armed forces in violation of the Russian
law that exempts conscripts from foreign service without their
consent.
</p>

<p>
In seventy-two hours these forces destroyed several hundred of
Ukraine’s armored vehicles, a substantial portion of its fighting
force. According to General Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied
Commander for Europe, the Russians used multiple launch rocket systems
armed with cluster munitions and thermobaric warheads (an even more
inhumane weapon that ought to be outlawed) with devastating effect.*
The local militia from the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk suffered
the brunt of the losses because they were communicating by cell phones
and could thus easily be located and targeted by the
Russians. President Putin has, so far, abided by a cease-fire
agreement he concluded with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on
September 5, but Putin retains the choice to continue the cease-fire
as long as he finds it advantageous or to resume a full-scale assault.
</p>

<p>
In September, President Poroshenko visited Washington where he
received an enthusiastic welcome from a joint session of Congress. He
asked for “both lethal and nonlethal” defensive weapons in his
speech. However, President Obama refused his request for Javelin
hand-held missiles that could be used against advancing
tanks. Poroshenko was given radar, but what use is it without
missiles? European countries are equally reluctant to provide military
assistance to Ukraine, fearing Russian retaliation. The Washington
visit gave President Poroshenko a façade of support with little
substance behind it.
</p>

<p>
Equally disturbing has been the determination of official
international leaders to withhold new financial commitments to Ukraine
until after the October 26 election there (which will take place just
after this issue goes to press). This has led to an avoidable pressure
on Ukrainian currency reserves and raised the specter of a full-blown
financial crisis in the country.
</p>

<p>
There is now pressure from donors, whether in Europe or the US, to
“bail in” the bondholders of Ukrainian sovereign debt, i.e., for
bondholders to take losses on their investments as a precondition for
further official assistance to Ukraine that would put more taxpayers’
money at risk. That would be an egregious error. The Ukrainian
government strenuously opposes the proposal because it would put
Ukraine into a technical default that would make it practically
impossible for the private sector to refinance its debt. Bailing in
private creditors would save very little money and it would make
Ukraine entirely dependent on the official donors.
</p>

<p>
To complicate matters, Russia is simultaneously dangling carrots and
wielding sticks. It is offering—but failing to sign—a deal for gas
supplies that would take care of Ukraine’s needs for the winter. At
the same time Russia is trying to prevent the delivery of gas that
Ukraine secured from the European market through Slovakia. Similarly,
Russia is negotiating for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to monitor the borders while continuing to
attack the Donetsk airport and the port city of Mariupol.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to foresee what lies ahead. Putin will await the results of
the elections on October 26 and then offer Poroshenko the gas and
other benefits he has been dangling on condition that he appoint a
prime minister acceptable to Putin. That would exclude anybody
associated with the victory of the forces that brought down the Viktor
Yanukovych government by resisting it for months on the
Maidan—Independence Square. I consider it highly unlikely that
Poroshenko would accept such an offer. If he did, he would be disowned
by the defenders of the Maidan; the resistance forces would then be
revived.
</p>

<p>
Putin may then revert to the smaller victory that would still be
within his reach: he could open by force a land route from Russia to
Crimea and Transnistria before winter. Alternatively, he could simply
sit back and await the economic and financial collapse of Ukraine. I
suspect that he may be holding out the prospect of a grand bargain in
which Russia would help the United States against ISIS—for instance by
not supplying to Syria the S300 missiles it has promised, thus in
effect preserving US air domination—and Russia would be allowed to
have its way in the “near abroad,” as many of the nations adjoining
Russia are called. What is worse, President Obama may accept such a
deal.
</p>

<p>
That would be a tragic mistake, with far-reaching geopolitical
consequences. Without underestimating the threat from ISIS, I would
argue that preserving the independence of Ukraine should take
precedence; without it, even the alliance against ISIS would fall
apart. The collapse of Ukraine would be a tremendous loss for NATO,
the European Union, and the United States. A victorious Russia would
become much more influential within the EU and pose a potent threat to
the Baltic states with their large ethnic Russian populations. Instead
of supporting Ukraine, NATO would have to defend itself on its own
soil. This would expose both the EU and the US to the danger they have
been so eager to avoid: a direct military confrontation with
Russia. The European Union would become even more divided and
ungovernable. Why should the US and other NATO nations allow this to
happen?
</p>

<p>
The argument that has prevailed in both Europe and the United States
is that Putin is no Hitler; by giving him everything he can reasonably
ask for, he can be prevented from resorting to further use of
force. In the meantime, the sanctions against Russia—which include,
for example, restrictions on business transactions, finance, and
trade—will have their effect and in the long run Russia will have to
retreat in order to earn some relief from them.
</p>

<p>
These are false hopes derived from a false argument with no factual
evidence to support it. Putin has repeatedly resorted to force and he
is liable to do so again unless he faces strong resistance. Even if it
is possible that the hypothesis could turn out to be valid, it is
extremely irresponsible not to prepare a Plan B.
</p>

<p>
There are two counterarguments that are less obvious but even more
important. First, Western authorities have ignored the importance of
what I call the “new Ukraine” that was born in the successful
resistance on the Maidan. Many officials with a history of dealing
with Ukraine have difficulty adjusting to the revolutionary change
that has taken place there. The recently signed Association Agreement
between the EU and Ukraine was originally negotiated with the
Yanukovych government. This detailed road map now needs adjustment to
a totally different situation. For instance, the road map calls for
the gradual replacement and retraining of the judiciary over five
years whereas the public is clamoring for immediate and radical
renewal. As the new mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, put it, “If you
put fresh cucumbers into a barrel of pickles, they will soon turn into
pickles.”
</p>

<p>
Contrary to some widely circulated accounts, the resistance on the
Maidan was led by the cream of civil society: young people, many of
whom had studied abroad and refused to join either government or
business on their return because they found both of them
repugnant. (Nationalists and anti-Semitic extremists made up only a
minority of the anti-Yanukovych protesters.) They are the leaders of
the new Ukraine and they are adamantly opposed to a return of the “old
Ukraine,” with its endemic corruption and ineffective government.
</p>

<p>
The new Ukraine has to contend with Russian aggression, bureaucratic
resistance both at home and abroad, and confusion in the general
population. Surprisingly, it has the support of many oligarchs,
President Poroshenko foremost among them, and the population at
large. There are of course profound differences in history, language,
and outlook between the eastern and western parts of the country, but
Ukraine is more united and more European-minded than ever before. That
unity, however, is extremely fragile.
</p>

<p>
The new Ukraine has remained largely unrecognized because it took time
before it could make its influence felt. It had practically no
security forces at its disposal when it was born. The security forces
of the old Ukraine were actively engaged in suppressing the Maidan
rebellion and they were disoriented this summer when they had to take
orders from a government formed by the supporters of the rebellion. No
wonder that the new government was at first unable to put up an
effective resistance to the establishment of the separatist enclaves
in eastern Ukraine. It is all the more remarkable that President
Poroshenko was able, within a few months of his election, to mount an
attack that threatened to reclaim those enclaves.
</p>

<p>
To appreciate the merits of the new Ukraine you need to have had some
personal experience with it. I can speak from personal experience
although I must also confess to a bias in its favor. I established a
foundation in Ukraine in 1990 even before the country became
independent. Its board and staff are composed entirely of Ukrainians
and it has deep roots in civil society. I visited the country often,
especially in the early years, but not between 2004 and early 2014,
when I returned to witness the birth of the new Ukraine.
</p>

<p>
I was immediately impressed by the tremendous improvement in maturity
and expertise during that time both in my foundation and in civil
society at large. Currently, civic and political engagement is
probably higher than anywhere else in Europe. People have proven their
willingness to sacrifice their lives for their country. These are the
hidden strengths of the new Ukraine that have been overlooked by the
West.
</p>

<p>
The other deficiency of the current European attitude toward Ukraine
is that it fails to recognize that the Russian attack on Ukraine is
indirectly an attack on the European Union and its principles of
governance. It ought to be evident that it is inappropriate for a
country, or association of countries, at war to pursue a policy of
fiscal austerity as the European Union continues to do. All available
resources ought to be put to work in the war effort even if that
involves running up budget deficits. The fragility of the new Ukraine
makes the ambivalence of the West all the more perilous. Not only the
survival of the new Ukraine but the future of NATO and the European
Union itself is at risk. In the absence of unified resistance it is
unrealistic to expect that Putin will stop pushing beyond Ukraine when
the division of Europe and its domination by Russia is in sight.
</p>

<p>
Having identified some of the shortcomings of the current approach, I
will try to spell out the course that Europe ought to
follow. Sanctions against Russia are necessary but they are a
necessary evil. They have a depressive effect not only on Russia but
also on the European economies, including Germany. This aggravates the
recessionary and deflationary forces that are already at work. By
contrast, assisting Ukraine in defending itself against Russian
aggression would have a stimulative effect not only on Ukraine but
also on Europe. That is the principle that ought to guide European
assistance to Ukraine.
</p>

<p>
Germany, as the main advocate of fiscal austerity, needs to understand
the internal contradiction involved. Chancellor Angela Merkel has
behaved as a true European with regard to the threat posed by
Russia. She has been the foremost advocate of sanctions on Russia, and
she has been more willing to defy German public opinion and business
interests on this than on any other issue. Only after the Malaysian
civilian airliner was shot down in July did German public opinion
catch up with her. Yet on fiscal austerity she has recently reaffirmed
her allegiance to the orthodoxy of the Bundesbank—probably in response
to the electoral inroads made by the Alternative for Germany, the
anti-euro party. She does not seem to realize how inconsistent that
is. She ought to be even more committed to helping Ukraine than to
imposing sanctions on Russia.
</p>

<p>
The new Ukraine has the political will both to defend Europe against
Russian aggression and to engage in radical structural reforms. To
preserve and reinforce that will, Ukraine needs to receive adequate
assistance from its supporters. Without it, the results will be
disappointing and hope will turn into despair. Disenchantment already
started to set in after Ukraine suffered a military defeat and did not
receive the weapons it needs to defend itself.
</p>

<p>
It is high time for the members of the European Union to wake up and
behave as countries indirectly at war. They are better off helping
Ukraine to defend itself than having to fight for themselves. One way
or another, the internal contradiction between being at war and
remaining committed to fiscal austerity has to be eliminated. Where
there is a will, there is a way.
</p>

<p>
Let me be specific. In its last progress report, issued in early
September, the IMF estimated that in a worst-case scenario Ukraine
would need additional support of $19 billion. Conditions have
deteriorated further since then. After the Ukrainian elections the IMF
will need to reassess its baseline forecast in consultation with the
Ukrainian government. It should provide an immediate cash injection of
at least $20 billion, with a promise of more when needed. Ukraine’s
partners should provide additional financing conditional on
implementation of the IMF-supported program, at their own risk, in
line with standard practice.
</p>

<p>
The spending of borrowed funds is controlled by the agreement between
the IMF and the Ukrainian government. Four billion dollars would go to
make up the shortfall in Ukrainian payments to date; $2 billion would
be assigned to repairing the coal mines in eastern Ukraine that remain
under the control of the central government; and $2 billion would be
earmarked for the purchase of additional gas for the winter. The rest
would replenish the currency reserves of the central bank.
</p>

<p>
The new assistance package would include a debt exchange that would
transform Ukraine’s hard currency Eurobond debt (which totals almost
$18 billion) into long-term, less risky bonds. This would lighten
Ukraine’s debt burden and bring down its risk premium. By
participating in the exchange, bondholders would agree to accept a
lower interest rate and wait longer to get their money back. The
exchange would be voluntary and market-based so that it could not be
mischaracterized as a default. Bondholders would participate willingly
because the new long-term bonds would be guaranteed—but only
partially—by the US or Europe, much as the US helped Latin America
emerge from its debt crisis in the 1980s with so-called Brady bonds
(named for US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady).
</p>

<p>
Such an exchange would have a few important benefits. One is that,
over the next two or three critical years, the government could use
considerably less of its scarce hard currency reserves to pay off
bondholders. The money could be used for other urgent needs.
</p>

<p>
By trimming Ukraine debt payments in the next few years, the exchange
would also reduce the chance of a sovereign default, discouraging
capital flight and arresting the incipient run on the banks. This
would make it easier to persuade owners of Ukraine’s banks (many of
them foreign) to inject urgently needed new capital into them. The
banks desperately need bigger capital cushions if Ukraine is to avoid
a full-blown banking crisis, but shareholders know that a debt crisis
could cause a banking crisis that wipes out their equity.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Ukraine would keep bondholders engaged rather than watch them
cash out at 100 cents on the dollar as existing debt comes due in the
next few years. This would make it easier for Ukraine to reenter the
international bond markets once the crisis has passed. Under the
current conditions it would be more practical and cost-efficient for
the US and Europe not to use their own credit directly to guarantee
part of Ukraine’s debt, but to employ intermediaries such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the World Bank and
its subsidiaries.
</p>

<p>
The Ukrainian state-owned company Naftogaz is a black hole in the
budget and a major source of corruption. Naftogaz currently sells gas
to households for $47 per thousand cubic meters (TCM), for which it
pays $380 per TCM. At present people cannot control the temperature in
their apartments. A radical restructuring of Naftogaz’s entire system
could reduce household consumption at least by half and totally
eliminate Ukraine’s dependence on Russia for gas. That would involve
charging households the market price for gas. The first step would be
to install meters in apartments and the second to distribute a cash
subsidy to needy households.
</p>

<p>
The will to make these reforms is strong both in the new management
and in the incoming government but the task is extremely complicated
(how do you define who is needy?) and the expertise is inadequate. The
World Bank and its subsidiaries could sponsor a project development
team that would bring together international and domestic experts to
convert the existing political will into bankable projects. The
initial cost would exceed $10 billion but it could be financed by
project bonds issued by the European Investment Bank and it would
produce very high returns.
</p>

<p>
It is also high time for the European Union to take a critical look at
itself. There must be something wrong with the EU if Putin’s Russia
can be so successful even in the short term. The bureaucracy of the EU
no longer has a monopoly of power and it has little to be proud of. It
should learn to be more united, flexible, and efficient. And Europeans
themselves need to take a close look at the new Ukraine. That could
help them recapture the original spirit that led to the creation of
the European Union. The European Union would save itself by saving
Ukraine.
